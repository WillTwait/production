# Welcome to the Tendrel Checklist app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun i
   ```

2. Setup environment
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env.local
   ```
   _You will need a clerk key, which can be retrieved from the Clerk dashboard._
   **Make sure you DO NOT use live keys, the keys should be prefixed with test**

3. 
   
   ### direnv
   I also recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which looks at a file called `.envrc`.
   You can use `.envrc` and `.env.local` in conjunction to load variables automatically into things like
   Maestro
   ```bash
   # sample .env.local
   MAESTRO_USERNAME=foo
   
   
   # .envrc
   dotenv .env.local
   ```

   And then simply run `direnv allow .`
   
3. Start the app

   ```bash
    bun ios
   # or bun android
   ```

## Adding translated text
1. Add the word/phrase to `i18n/corpus.json`
2. Run `aws sso login <your-profile-name>`
3. Run `bun translate`

## Inspecting the SQLite database
After starting the app with `bun:ios|android`, enter `shift + m` in the terminal and select `Open expo-drizzle-studio-plugin`

## Migrations
After making a change to `schema.ts`, simply run
```bash
bun generate
```

Migrations will be applied the next time the app is reloaded.

## Developing locally with the @tendrel/sdk package
From the `@tendrel/sdk` package, run
```bash
bun link
```

From this package, run
```bash
bun link @tendrel/sdk --save
```

Make sure `localSdkPath` in `metro.config.js` is correctly set to your sdk package dir.

## Testing
[Install Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)

Make sure to fill out the `MAESTRO` section of `.env.local` and also load
those into your env via `dotenv` or `direnv` as explained above.

```bash
# To run all tests
maestro test test/flows

# To run one specific flow
maestro test test/flows/<flow>.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

If your simulator can't connect to the dev server, make sure you are using the node version specified in
`.nvmrc`. You can ensure consistency by [installing nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) and 
running

```bash
nvm use
```
